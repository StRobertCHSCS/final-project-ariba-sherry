## Connect4 Game

#### Objective of Game and Instructions

The game we created is Connect4. The purpose of the game is for a team to get four coins in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This game can only be played with two players; each representing a team with a specific colour. The first team, represented by the colour red, will choose a column that they want to drop their chip into. After the first team has dropped their chip, the next team (blue) will choose a column that they want to drop their chip into. The first team who connects four chips in a row will win the round. The game then pauses for a while and restarts; all the chip slots will become empty and the two teams can start a new round. 

##### Instructions for using keypress 

The "1" key on the the player's keyboard represents the first column of the Connect4 grid.
"2" represents the second column, "3" is the third, "4" is the fourth, "5" is the fifth, "6" is the last column. 

Ex: if your team wants to put a chip into the second column, press the key with the number "2"

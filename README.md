## Connect4 Game

#### Objective of Game and Instructions

The game we created is Connect4. The purpose of the game is for a team to get four coins in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This game can only be played with two players; each representing a team with a specific colour. The first team, represented by the colour red, will choose a column that they want to drop their chip into. After the first team has dropped their chip, the next team (blue) will choose a column that they want to drop their chip into. The first team who connects four chips in a row will win the round. The game then pauses for a while and restarts; all the chip slots will become empty and the two teams can start a new round.
